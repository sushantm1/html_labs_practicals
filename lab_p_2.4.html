<h2>Recipe:</h2>
<b>
Ingredients Required -  </b> ½ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric)<br>
1 teaspoon red chili powder or paprika or cayenne pepper<br>
1 teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander)<br>
1 teaspoon cumin powder (ground cumin)<br>
1 teaspoon garam masala powder<br>
1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder)<br>
1 teaspoon chaat masala powder<br>

<ul>
<li>
    Rinse 500 grams bhindi (okra or ladies’ finger) well in water. Then, wipe them dry with a kitchen napkin. Or you can spread them on a large plate and let them dry naturally.

    The bhindi should be completely dry before you start marinating it with spices. There should not be any moisture or water droplets on them. Otherwise they will not become as crispy as you want.
</li>
<li>Remove the crown and base tip of the bhindi. Slice the bhindi vertically into 4 pieces. If you have small sized bhindi, then slice into 2 pieces. Take the sliced bhindi on a large thali/plate or bowl


</li>
<li>
    Add ½ cup gram flour (besan) on the bhindi. Instead of gram flour you can add chickpea flour too.

    Though I have only used gram flour, feel free to add a few tablespoons of rice flour for added crispiness. 
</li>

<li>Gently mix the gram flour, spice powders and salt with the bhindi. Remember that the gram flour and ground spices must evenly coat all the okra slices.


</li>
<li> Now Do it Yourself</li>

</ul>
