    "Never consider your opponent, your enemy smaller than you. What Ravana thought of as ordinary apes and bears destroyed his entire army."<br><br>
    "Supporting the unrighteous is also the cause of destruction."<br><br>
    "When a manâ€™s destruction comes, his intellect gets corrupted."<br><br>
    "Mother and motherland are greater than heaven!"<br><br>
    "By the grace of Shri Ram, everything is possible."
